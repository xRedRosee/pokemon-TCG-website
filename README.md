# Pokemon Trading Card Game Website

This website contains a lot of information about the most famous trading card game in the world: Pokemon!

## What can you do on this website?

You can see different Pokemon TCG cards from different sets. Filter by set and series and search for your specific card!
Curious about the value of your card? See the value charts displayed at the card pages. You can see all the Pokemon series and choose which one you want to see the set from. After choosing a set you get a list with all the cards! The cards all have names, rarities, number and of course values! All the info you want to know about a card can easily be found when navigating through the series, sets and cardlist.

## Why did I make this website?

I created this website because I collect the Pokemon TCG myself. But of course I also created this website because I want to learn working with NPM, libraries and Vite. I used different libraries for this website, such as GlideJS for the slideshows, AnimeJS for animations and ChartJS for the value charts. The values that are inside the charts can be found inside pokemontcg.json > SV1 > CardList > value.
Here are all the values and can be changed.
Animations on the about page are created with AnimeJS. The animation functions can be found in aboutanimations.js and can be changed here.
The first animation is for the welcome svg file. Here is the strokedash animation created. The other function inside this file is for the Pokeballs.

## Libraries used:

- GlideJS
- ChartJS
- AnimeJS
